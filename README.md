Minimal 2 person drawing application


What I want to create:
2 Way communication drawing application with a minimal interface and amount of tools.
One user must be the host, starting a separate server program
  The second user will connect their program to the ip address of the computer the hosting user
The users will be able to draw to the canvas section of the screen and then send their drawings to each other via the server
  When one user presses the send button, everything on their screen will be sent to the other user, and place that image on top of whatever is already on their screen
The user will only draw in black and white
  Can increase the size of the line being drawn
  Can switch to an eraser
